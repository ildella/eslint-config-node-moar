# An opinionated linter based on ESLint

Across multiple Node.js projects, I use the same linter

  * ESLint with node reccomended defaults
  * A few plugins (node, security, sonarjs and jest)
  * A very strict and opinionated rule set

I was tired to copy-paste config and deps across projects, so I created a shareable eslint config for myself. Eventually could be interesting for somebody else as well.
